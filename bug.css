The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a `width` property where the containing element's width is not yet defined might lead to an incorrect calculation or layout issues.  Another common error involves incorrect operator precedence or missing parentheses, leading to errors in the calculation.
